# tsg-data

Thermosalinograph data compiled from several repositories, as described in Drushka et al., Journal of Physical Oceanography, 2019.

All data have been quality-controlled.

Measurements are at their original time and space resolution.

Data from a single respository (e.g., SOCAT) is stored in a single matlab-format (.mat) file that contains a readme with information about the file.
